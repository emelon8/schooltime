# schooltime
Calculate how long you've been at school, based on time stamps entered into a text file by an IFTTT recipe (https://ifttt.com/applets/236154p-time-at-location).

The directory schooltime_library contains a library that contains useful methods for calculating the time in a human-readable format.

When compiled and run, this application brings up a small window where users can enter the paths of two output files of the IFTTT recipe (when they entered campus and when they exited campus). When users click "Compute!", the application automatically calculates the average daily length of time they are on campus.
